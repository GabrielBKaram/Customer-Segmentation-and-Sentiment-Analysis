# Customer-Segmentation-and-Sentiment-Analysis
In this notebook, I will analyze trends in online shopping in Brazil between 2016 and 2018. I will first start with performing an extensive EDA on the 8 datasets that I have in order to understand the initial variables at hand (growth in sales, most purchased products, cities with the most online purchases, etc.).

In the first part of the analysis, I will work on building a sentimental analysis model using NLP that predicts whether the customer is satisfied with their online purchase or not based on the reviews and scores they keep after completing the purchase and receiving the product.

In the second part, I will cluster the different users of the website into low, medium and high value users using the RFM metrics (recency, frequency and monetary) to predict which segment of clients yields the highest returns thus should be the priority clients of the ecommerce website.

It is best to view this notebook on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to be able to see the plots.
